<p style="font-style:normal;font-weight:500">I am Harrison Jude. I am a wide-eyed dreamer with my head in the clouds, but I'm also a hard worker who's not afraid to get my hands dirty. I believe in the power of design and the responsibility that comes with it. That' s why I push myself to create bolder, more effective designs, as well as better and more efficient workflows to create them. Because good design is good through and through! </p>

<p style="font-style:normal;font-weight:500">I would like to think that I am good at what I do, not because I am the best designer in the world, but rather because I am a lifelong learner and kid at heart. Wise enough to say “I don’t know,” but bold enough to dive wholeheartedly into the unknown to learn and deliver. I love to explore new things and I'm always up for an adventure. So, what are we going to create together? Let's dream big and make the impossible possible!</p>
